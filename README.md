# Lab2

i learnt alot about arrays and that vectors just feel so much easier. I also got a better feel for c++ syntax.
as the first lab i overcame alot of easyily solvable problems by using google, i did not understand the header files or why i had to
basiclly copy all my work ive already done into another project just so i could have a menu for it when i couldve just used the same main function for all of them.

Just like the previous lab the instructions are VERY hard to follow, especially in task 7, i probably spent more than an entire days work trying to get it right.
please make the lab instructions more clear in the future, also are there suppose to be images in the lab? beacuse if so they are not loading at all.

i probably spent over 50+ hours on this task.
